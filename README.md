# Cyber Shoppy (Simple E-Commerce Website in PHP)

The website shopping system (Online Shopping System) was using the internet as the sole method for selling goods to its consumers. It would allow customers to register with the site and purchase goods online. Using sessions to save users, users can add and purchase products. Various products where displayed through a database, in the index page as well as categorized and dispalyed int subdetails page, from where the user can view the products or selected items by clicking the Quick View button that appears while hovering the cursor over a specific item in Subdetails page.

Once viewed the product properlyand checked if the quality of item meets the expectation of customer, they can add item to the cart from where the user can select partcular item and buy it and can also buy all the items present in the cart. The cart page fulfills almost the use of both wishlist and cart int this shoppping site.

 Since it was my first E-commerce website project, which have been done in a duration of 6 months(approx) as major project while pursing my MCA degree,so payment gateway mechanism is yet to be provided. Hopefull in upcomin days it will be added.

By clicking on the “Sign in” link, the Modal for login appears at the top of the screen. Then by putting the correct credentials in the correct fields, a user can login to their account thereby clicking on the “LOGIN” button, if the user account already exists.
